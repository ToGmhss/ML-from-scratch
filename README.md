# ML-from-scratch
Machine Learning practice, a collection of useful algorithms. Interesting topics like AIOps, Recommendation Systems, and Time Series are also included. Last, AutoML is a great tool that can save much time.

# Intro
This is a repo with part of the algorithms I have experience with. Most of my codes are written in Python, rest in R. 

For the coding from scratch, please refer to the section "code-from-scratch", it contatins classical supervised algorithms like KNN and unsupervised algorithms like KMeans.  

Other part are my interested area of AI&ML, including AIOps, Recommendation Systems, and Time Series. I also practiced using AutoML, which can produce good results without trouble of feature engineering and building models.
